# Calabressella

Trick-taking game with the object to capture the cards worth points.
One person will bid to player against the other two for getting majority of the points.

## The Cards and Points

40-card deck. 3's and 2's are highest.

**3, 2, A, K, Q, J, 7, 6, 5, 4**

3's and 2's are worth a third of a point.
A's are 1 full point.
Face cards are third of a point.
Taking the last trick is 1 full point.
Total points is 11 2/3.

Whoever is the taker needs to get 6+ card points to win.

## The Deal and Bidding

Deal 12 cards to each player and 4 to the *monte*.

Starting with left of the dealer, each player has one chance to bid or pass.

1. *Chiamo* - Bidder calls for a card from defenders AND exchanges with the *monte*
1. *Solo* - Exchanges with the *monte* only
1. *Solissimo* - No card calling or exchanging, but get to start the first trick

Each higher bid increases the risk of failure but also increases the reward.

## The Exchange

**Calling for a Card**
Taker names a card and suit (usually a 3 they're missing).
The defender has to give the card to the taker.
Sometimes neither defenders have the desired card. That means it's in the *monte*.

**Exchange with the *Monte***
Taker flips the *monte* face-up for all to see, then they are added to the taker's hand.
Taker gives a card to the defender missing the called card.
Taker discards an 4 cards face-down to form a new *monte*.
The winner of the last trick wins the *monte*.

**Optional: *Dividete* and *Scegliete***
A taker who bid *Solissimo* may increase the stakes further by declaring *Dividete* or *Scegliete*.

- *Dividete* - the defenders each draw two cards from the monte, without having previously looked at them and without showing them, and then each discard any two of their 14 cards face down.
- *Scegliete* - the defenders turn the monte face up and choose which cards they should each take (they can be distributed in any way - not necessarily two each). Each defender then discards face down as many cards as they took, so that everyone has 12 cards.

## The Play

Left of the dealer starts the first trick, except in a *Solissimo* game.
The taker starts then.

Whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick and starts the next one.
There are no trumps.

## Scoring

- *Chiamo*: ₤1
- *Solo*: ₤2
- *Solissimo*: ₤4
  - *Dividete*: ₤8
  - *Scegliete*: ₤16

**Special**
- *Cappotto*: taker wins or loses all tricks - doubled
- *Stramazzo*: losers have less than a point but one at least one trick - tripled

## (Optional) *Spazzatura*

If everyone passes, a round of *Spazzatura* is played.
The goal is to when as few points as possible.
