Extra card is dealt face-up to indicate trump.
It does not go to the dealer.

### Tarot

Play with a 78-card tarot deck. The major suit is permanent trump.

- Deal 8 cards instead of 5
- Need 2 tricks to not go boo

The *Fool* is a special card.
It can be played at any time to save a better card, but can never win a trick itself.
If it starts the trick, next player sets the suit with their card.
